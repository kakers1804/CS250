How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  How I interpret user needs is by asking the user what they are looking for and then once the ask is clear, I then   implement it into my code. Creating user stories helps with this by getting the information needed from the         customer and setting up a basis for the work needed.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  How I approach developing programs is by writing suedo code to help outline the program's functionallity and then   begining by developing a few lines of code at a time. An agile process that I hope to incorporate into my future    developement is to start working on a couple of different parts of the program at a the same time with small        improvements along the way.
